# Constraints on the Wilson coefficients C<sub>7</sub> and C'<sub>7</sub>

The plots inside this repository ("[C7_C7p.pdf](https://github.com/peterstangl/constraints_c7_c7p/blob/master/C7_C7p.pdf)" and "[C7_C7p_BR_separately.pdf](https://github.com/peterstangl/constraints_c7_c7p/blob/master/C7_C7p_BR_separately.pdf)") show the constraints on the Wilson coefficients C<sub>7</sub> and C'<sub>7</sub>, derived from several fits that include different combinations of observables.

The notebook "[Numerics for constraints on C7 and C7p.ipynb](https://github.com/peterstangl/constraints_c7_c7p/blob/master/Numerics%20for%20constraints%20on%20C7%20and%20C7p.ipynb)" can be used to generate the data file "[data.p](https://github.com/peterstangl/constraints_c7_c7p/blob/master/data.p)", which is used by the notebook "[Plots of constraints on C7 and C7p.ipynb](https://github.com/peterstangl/constraints_c7_c7p/blob/master/Plots%20of%20constraints%20on%20C7%20and%20C7p.ipynb)" to generate the plots.

All of this is based on [compagnion scripts](https://github.com/DavidMStraub/paper-bvgamma-ps) to the paper [arXiv:1608.02556](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02556) by Ayan Paul and David M. Straub.

The numerics is based on [flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/).
